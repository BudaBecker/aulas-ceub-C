# C Language Study CEUB

This repository serves as a personal archive of my learning journey in the C programming language, primarily focusing on materials and projects developed during my college classes. Here, you'll find a collection of code examples, solved exercises, study notes, and small projects I've created to solidify my understanding of C.

## Contents

This repository contains materials related to the following core C programming concepts I've studied:

* **Fundamentals:**
    * Data types
    * Variables and constants
    * Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
    * Control flow structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
    * Looping structures (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
    * Basic input and output operations (`printf`, `scanf`)
* **Functions:**
    * Function definition and declaration
    * Parameter passing (by value, by reference via pointers)
* **Data Structures:**
    * Arrays (one-dimensional and multi-dimensional)
    * Strings (character arrays and basic string manipulation)
    * Pointers (fundamental concepts, pointer arithmetic)
    * Pointer usage with arrays and functions
    * Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
    * User-defined data types (`struct`, `union`)

## Disclaimer

This is a personal repository created for my own learning and reference. While the code and notes are based on my college studies, they may not be exhaustive or represent the most advanced or production-ready solutions.
